This is a simple mandatory project for Databases 2.
So the intentions with this application are on the one Hand connecting to a database and using its logic => System Procedures, Triggers, Functions, Cursors)
and on the other hand i am developing a GUI via javafx which will display datasets.

To be more precisely about this projecs it is an application which should help its user filtering through car brands and models.

"I want a BMW 3 series which fuel to power ration is the best." <= This should be realized.
